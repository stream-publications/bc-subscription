## Overview
bc-subscription is a bigcommerce app for creating ðŸ’ª flexible ðŸ“–publication subscription service.

### Why built this app?
All the existing subscription apps only creates subscription service for recurring payment for the same product. This does not work for publication subscription where each publication is a different product with a varied price. This app aims to provide a solution the following use cases:

### Use case

	- Publication period is not defined. The customer will receive a new publication whenever it is published.
	- The publication title is different at every publication. Customer is billed on the latest publication title.
	- The publication price is not set. The customer subscribe to a product series with no fix price.
- Customer should be able to adjust the quantity of product they are subscribing. This means the customer can change the number of - copies of the publications they are ordering.
- Account customers can subscribe without paying upfront. They will be invoiced to be paid later.
- General customers must store their credit card so they are charged at when a new publication is issued.
- Shop staff controls what product is added to the new publication or issue.
- New publication or issue is created on demand by the shop staff. Basically, whenever the new publication is ready for print.

### Start Service

In a terminal, execute the following in the root of the project directory to start ngrok: 

`ngrok start --config ngrok.yml site`
