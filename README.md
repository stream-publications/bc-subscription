### Setup ngrok tunnel for app

 2. Retrieve and replace the auth token in the `ngrok.yml` file
 3. Set `authtoken` in `ngrok.yml` file with value from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started
 4. Set hostname to `<username>.ngrok.io` in the `ngrok.yml` file.

	 Notes: 

	  - The username can be whatever you like

### Setup BC App

 1. Log into your store's [dev tools](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps)
 2. Create an app and in the "Technical" section, set the following URLs:

	  - Auth Callback URL: `https://<username>.ngrok.io/.netlify/functions/bigcommerce_auth`
	  - Load Callback URL: `https://<username>.ngrok.io/.netlify/functions/bigcommerce_load`
	  - Uninstall Callback URL: `https://<username>.ngrok.io/.netlify/functions/bigcommerce_uninstall`

 3. Select "modify" permissions for the following scopes:

### Setup .env

 1. `cp .env-sample .env`

 2. Update and replace the following in `.env`:

	- BC_CLIENT_ID: BigCommerce App Client Id
	- BC_CLIENT_SECRET: BigCommerce App Secret

	- BC_AUTH_CALLBACK: Replace with Auth Callback URL from above
	- APP_URL= Replace with ngrok hostname from above `https://<username>.ngrok.io/`

Note: The environment variables in `.env` will also need to be set in Netlify in order for the deployed version to work. [TODO]

### Start Service

In a terminal, execute the following in the root of the project directory to start ngrok: 

`ngrok start --config ngrok.yml site`

*Note*: if you stop and restart this process, it will give you a new host domain that you will need to update for each of the 3 Callback URLs in your app's dev tools section

In another terminal execute in the root of the project directory to start the service: 

`yarn netlify:dev`

The service will live reload on saved changes.  If you want to restart simply stop the `yarn netlify:dev` process and restart it, 
there should be no need to restart ngrok.
